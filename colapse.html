<h2>Heyyyy sunshine, U thought that message was it? no no obv nahi ;D </h2>


<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open Whenever u miss me </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Heyyy cutie <br>
    Ik u want me next to u, hugging u and comforting but sadly i cant be there (at least for now hehehe) however what i can do is write a message for u to remind u that u are not aloneee and that im always with u, in ur heart and in ur thoughts. <br>
    I am also currently thinking about u, its sooo crazy that i miss u like the whole time when we are not talking. Theres so many people and the only one i want rn is u. This message may not be the same as having me nest to u rn so u can hug be like ur private teddy bear, but i sure this will bring a peice of my heart to u sunshine &#128158 &#128158.<br>
    Hehe so dw think of all the times we were together, when u steal my controller cause u started losing in mario kart  or when u kiss me to distract me from winning and all the hugs u gave me, its all still there and it always will be. so just close ur eyes and rememeber how its like when u and i are together. Just remeber this distance rn is temperory only, just until next year cause then we will get to meet each other soooo muchhh. <br>
    So when we do see each other, Im giving u the biggest hug ever, ill be like a panda hugging u. Promise. 
  </p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open when u need a hug </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
   Heyyyyy cutie, i hope ur opening this at the right time, not as soon as u see it heheheh ahhhh I wish I could be there right now huggind u and cuddling with u, and letting u know just how much i really love you buttttttt since I cant do that rn physically (yet), ill write this so it may make u feel like im hugging u rn <br>

Ik i cant come hug u always and on days like today, when u just need comfort, I want u to know im right here and im also always always available to text or call whenever ur heart desires. Close ur eyes, feel my arms around u, my hand in urs, my head resting on ur shoulder. I may not be with u rn but my love will definetly be here for u always and forever.

Just know that u are so deeply loved And even though im not there to hug u rn, ill send u all the warmth, comfort, and love I can in this little wensite message (hehehehehe). <br>

So here’s ur virtual hug my princess
🤗💞💫🫂❤️<br> <br> 

 U my sweet sweet panda are never alone, even when it feels that way rn. I caat wait for the next time we meet and i can give u a real hug :)
</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open only when u want a kiss </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>
   I dont really know how to write anything here without it sounding seducing :O, hehehe maybe i can add a vm here? ok nahi nahi u are gonna get vms and video messages<br>
   So cutie, <br> <br>
  U need a kiss rn? :D  Well, lucky you—because I have got one (or a thousand) waiting just for u. 😘 <br>

I wish that I could be there rn to press my lips gently yours, to kiss away all ur the stress and the loneliness that ur feeling rn. If ur having a rough day or just missing me like crazy ( Im missing u too sunshine), I hope this little note brings a smile to ur pretty pretty face.

Close ur eyes for a second (omg i said this in all 3 of them but this is the best way i can make it feel like im there rn) imagine me leaning in, slowly, wrapping my arms around u, and giving u the softest kiss 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 . Just know that its filled with all the love in the world and it means that im here and im completelty urs. <Br><br>

One on ur forehead because u said u love them so very much<br>
One for ur cheeks cause omg u look so happy when i do that<br>
And a long one on ur lips because i love u and also u taste like litchis<br>
