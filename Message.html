    So sunshine heheheh ur 18, congradulationsssss, omg did i spell that wrong bruhhhh, no auto correct here to help me ig, but yes so 18 finally, ur an adulttt, yeah yeah ik ull say no significant thing like itna bada kuch nahi hua hai and all, and yes ur right<br>

But ok yes so this is technically our one year anniversary, technically speakingggg ok to the point now, its been one year since u walked gracefully into my life and it has only been the best ever since then
Like i have so much to say Idek where to begin, because trying to put everything about how much u mean to me into words feels literally impossible, but lets go ill try my best. <br>

Since the very first moment I met u, in the tution where i pretend to always forget my textbook so that u can share urs with me (yes sunshine that was on purpose), my entire world shifted. The best i can say is like everything before u was black and white, same thing over and over again, wake play study sleep and the moment u walked in, it was like a burst of color I didnt even know my life was missing. U didnt just change my life in a small way, u transformed it completely. U showed me new levels of happiness and love and what it feels like to be loved for exactly who I am.
U didnt judge or anything like that, u listened and then accepted and for that i am so very thankful snehal. U have been there through my highs and lows not just being with me but supporting me when I most needed it, and during exam period u believe in me when even I couldnt believe in myself. Your laughter has become my favorite sound, the only thing i wish to hear. Your smile? Its literally the only thing that i wanna see on my bad days. Your voice makes me calm and your hugs brings me peace. U have become my safe place, my peace, my home.
Whenever I look at U, i feel like god heard me and said, heres the most perfect girl in existance for u and u are everything I have ever hoped to find in another person kindness, strength, beauty, softness, and this crazy and magical ability to make everything better just by being near me and by my side. Not to be cheesy or corny but u remind me every day that real love still exists in this world, not like the love people like shruti and all say they have. And this is why i do so much for u snehal, cause u are worth it, u are worth every single minute of it.
And as much as u have already changed my life sooo much just by being in it <a href="https://vedant2825.github.io/Message/colapse.html" target="_blank">.</a> <br>

I realllllllyyyyyyy hope that this is only the beginning. Because I promise I am not going anywhere. Im going to keep loving you fully, endlessly, and with everything I have. Im going to keep showing up on all ur sepcial ocassions, im gonna be here for ur next birthday and all birthdays after that, supporting you and protecting ur heart like its the most precious thing Ive ever held because it actually is. My love for you is not going to be temporary, Its definetly not a phase or a moment. Its forever and thats a promise.
you have changed my life, and i will spend the rest of mine loving u for it. &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149 &#128149</div>
